### The Role of AI in Threat Detection  
AI enables the rapid analysis of large volumes of data to detect anomalies. Using machine learning models, it identifies suspicious behaviors and prevents potential attacks before they materialize.  

### Automating Incident Responses  
AI systems react in real-time to threats. For example:  
- Automatically isolating compromised devices.  
- Removing malicious files.  

### A Proactive Approach to Prevention  
By predicting attacks based on data patterns, AI anticipates the tactics used by cybercriminals, proactively protecting organizations.
