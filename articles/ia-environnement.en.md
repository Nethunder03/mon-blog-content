## Introduction  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a key role in the transition towards a sustainable world. From managing natural resources to reducing carbon emissions, it opens new avenues to address environmental challenges.

## Main Content  

### Optimizing Natural Resources  
AI enables efficient monitoring and management of natural resources. For instance:
- Analyzing climate data to predict extreme weather events.
- Smart water management through connected sensors.  

### Reducing Carbon Footprint  
AI algorithms can reduce carbon emissions by optimizing industrial processes and logistics chains. Examples include:
- Route optimization in transportation to lower fuel consumption.
- Improving energy efficiency in buildings.  

### Preserving Biodiversity  
Through drones and cameras powered by AI, wildlife and vegetation can be monitored and protected against threats such as deforestation or poaching.
